Create a plan first before big work

/memory
You can edit 
1. user memory in CLAUDE.md in .claude folder in ...
2. project memory in CLAUDE.md in project

For big plans:
"Make the plan multi-phase"

/context
See how much context is left for you

If context is ending -> You can ask claude code to create a github issue 
and check whats have been done, ...

/clear - clear context window

claude --continue if u exited the session

My workflow with this project

1. Understand the task & whats setup required
2. Download whats needed and start building using phases
