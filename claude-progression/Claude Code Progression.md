If context is ending -> You can ask claude code to create a github issue
and check whats have been done, ...

/clear - clear context window

claude --continue if u exited the session

My workflow with this project

1. Understand the task & whats setup required
2. Download whats needed and start building using phases

Claude couldn't get right:

Used wrongly Google AI with wrong lib: langchanin... instead of importing
GoogleChat from browser_use...

in caleprocure - the PDFs are not automatically downloaded but pop up in a new window.
This is something Claude struggled with until I updated the web-search's llm (google flasg) prompt
